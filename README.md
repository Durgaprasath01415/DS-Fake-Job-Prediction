# 🧰DS-Fake-Job-Prediction✍🏽📑


### Problem Statement:
    
      In this project, we have build a machine learning model that detects fake job postings based on textual information such as job descriptions, company names, locations, and requirements. The model will help job portals and applicants identify and avoid fraudulent job offers.


### Dataset: Fake Job Postings Prediction

### Approach:
    
1. Data Collection
    
       Used the Fake Job Postings dataset from Kaggle.
      
       It contains structured and unstructured features including job titles, descriptions, locations, and labels indicating whether the posting is fake.
   
2. Data Preprocessing
      
       Handled missing values and irrelevant columns
          
       Cleaned text: remove HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, and lowercase
          
       Tokenization and lemmatization
    
3. Feature Extraction
      
       Used TF-IDF vectorization
    
       Used SMOTE to balance the imbalance dependent data
          
       Combine multiple features using a unified feature matrix
    
4. Model Building and Training
      
       Train models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGBoost Classifier
          
       Have handled class imbalance to the training/validation using imblearn

5. Model Evaluation
      
       Focus on Precision, Recall, and F1-Score since false positives can severely impact user trust
          
       Plot Confusion Matrix to assess class-wise performance
          
       Consider using ROC-AUC score for final model validation
    
6. Prediction and Deployment
      
       Test the model on new/unseen job postings
      
### Results: 
      
    Achieved 99% AUC with Support Vector Classification and 98% AUC with XGBoost Classifier
